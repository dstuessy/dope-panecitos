## Equipment
- Large mixing bowl
- A frying pan
- [optional] A mixing spoon

## Ingredients
- 4 Cups flour
- 4 tsp baking powder
- 2 tsp salt
- 0.5 Cups oil -- yes.
- 1.5 Cups water

## Steps to produce

### Mixing ingredients
1. Add all the dry ingredients together in the mixing bowl
2. Add all the oil into the bowl and mix them together to form many many lumps
3. Add the water into the mixture by pouring it into a little well in the middle
4. Mix the mixture together into a dough

### Kneeding the dough
1. Once mixed, start kneeding it by pulling it away from you and folding it back towards you
    - Do this for several minutes whilst making sure all the large lumps of oil and flour mix into the dough
    - It should form a very wet, sticky dough that clings to itself despite sticking on the table
    - Kneed until smooth, but it doesn't have to be too smooth

### Cooking
1. Whack a frying pan on a stove with medium high temperature
2. Give yourself a moment to admire your dough; maybe poke it to see how springy it is and take a breath
3. Divide the dough into eight equal pieces
    - I like to use a thin spatula for this as it cuts through it easily
    - Form each piece into a little ball and set it aside
4. Flatten each dough piece so it's about 0.5cm to 0.8cm thick
    - I use a rigid flat object to press down on them with my body weight, then scrape them off with a very thin spatula. This gives it a puffy shape on the rim with a thinner center
    - I also place flour on the table to stop the dough from sticking to it
5. Place as many of these flattened pieces onto your frying pan as it is
    - I haven't had to use any oil to prevent the bread from sticking to the pan
6. Let it cook for a few minutes
    - You'll see the dough rise and lose some of its glaze on the top
    - Once you feel ready, flip the bread over and wait as long as you're comfortable
    - I don't use a timer for this, I suggest you time yourself the first time to try and get a reliable number
7. Remove your panecitos from the frying pan with a spatula

### Done
Enjoy your panecitos. Maybe wait several minutes for them to cool. I like to slice them in half and spread some peanut butter or marmite. I also like making grilled cheese sandwiches with them. They're also great for non-grilled sandwiches, or just to look at!
